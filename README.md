# TimelessADTs-Immutable-Data-Structures
• Created basic immutable ADTs for three concepts of time: Duration, Time, and Period.
• Developed the Duration ADT to signify a non-negative time interval, supporting operations like addition, subtraction, scaling, and division.
• Constructed the Time ADT to denote a specific historical moment, with functionalities such as calculating time differences, and performing addition and subtraction.
• Designed the Period ADT to encapsulate a span of historical time, featuring methods to access start and end times, determine duration, and assess overlaps.
• Adhered to best practices for immutable ADTs, including overriding essential methods like equals, hashCode, and toString.
• Employed JUnit testing to verify the accuracy and functionality of the ADTs.
